# robot-framework
Boilerplate code for FRC robot projects. Uses controller objects to route signals, giving the end user more flexibility with their programs. Supports unit testing on subsystems without requiring a physical robot to run on. Users can expand on existing code to create custom controllable objects with their own set of controllers to fit their teams specific needs.
